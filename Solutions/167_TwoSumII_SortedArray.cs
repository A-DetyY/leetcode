/*(Easy)
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, 
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, 
where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
 

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
nums is sorted in increasing order.
-1000 <= target <= 1000
